# SmallWeb theme for Pelican static site generator

This is a simple yet modern-looking theme for Pelican blogs. It uses no
JavaScript, and all HTML/CSS had been crafted by hand - remember [webmasters]?

Theme name is inspired by the idea of [small web] - a simpler old-style web of
personal pages that didn't actually go anywhere but has become a lot less
visible as Internet had grown older and larger.
